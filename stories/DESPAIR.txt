DESPAIR (Poetry:- Ages 3 to 5)



  SMILE on me, mouth of red--so much too red,

  Shine on me, eyes which darkened lashes shade,

  Turn, turn my way, oh glorious golden head,

  My soul is lost, then let the price be paid!

  Amid rich flowers your rosy lamplight gleams,

  Amid rich hangings pass your scented hours,

  And woods and fields are green but in my dreams,

  And only in my dreams grow meadow-flowers.



  I have forgotten everything but you--

  The apple orchard where the whitethroat sings,

  The quiet fields, the moonlight, and the dew,

  The virgin's bower that in wet hedgerow clings.

  I have forgotten how the cool grass waves

  Where clean winds blow, and where good women pray

  For happy, honest men, safe in their graves;

  And--oh, my God! I would I were as they!
