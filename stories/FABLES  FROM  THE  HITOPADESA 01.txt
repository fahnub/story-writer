The  Camel  and  the  Pig (Fables:- Ages 3 to 5)

A  Camel  said:  "Nothing  like  being  tall!    Look  how  tall  I  am!"

A  Pig,  who  heard  these  words,  said:  "Nothing  like  being  short!    Look    how  short  I  am!"

The  Camel  said:  "Well,  if  I  fail  to  prove  the  truth  of  what  I  said,  I    shall  give  up  my  hump."

The  Pig  said:  "If  I  fail  to  prove  the  truth  of  what  I  have  said,  I    shall  give  up  my  snout."

"Agreed!"  said  the  Camel.

"Just  so!"  said  the  Pig.

They  came  to  a  garden,  enclosed  by  a  low  wall  without  any  opening.    The    Camel  stood  on  this  side  the  wall,  and  reaching  the  plants  within  by    means  of  his  long  neck  made  a  breakfast  on  them.    Then  he  turned    jeeringly  to  the  Pig,  who  had  been  standing  at  the  bottom  of  the  wall    without  even  a  look  at  the  good  things  in  the  garden,  and  said:  "Now,    would  you  be  tall,  or  short?"

Next  they  came  to  a  garden,  enclosed  by  a  high  wall,  with  a  wicket  gate    at  one  end.    The  Pig  entered  by  the  gate  and,  after  having  eaten  his    fill  of  the  vegetables  within,  came  out,  laughing  at  the  poor  Camel,    who  had  had  to  stay  outside,  because  he  was  too  tall  to  enter  the    garden  by  the  gate,  and  said:  "Now,  would  you  be  tall,  or  short?"

Then  they  thought  the  matter  over,  and  came  to  the  conclusion  that  the    Camel  should  keep  his  hump  and  the  Pig  his  snout,  observing:  "_Tall  is    good,  where  tall  would  do;  if  short,  again,  'tis  also  true!_"
